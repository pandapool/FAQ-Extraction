SUBJECT,TOPIC,QUESTION
operating system,fcfs,
,,a) the number on the overview screen corresponds to the total of luws (see  also first question) that were written to the qrfc queue and that have not yet  been confirmed. the detail screen displays the records contained in the luws.  both  the records belonging to the previous delta request and the records that  do not meet the selection conditions of the preceding delta init requests are  filtered out. thus  only the records that are ready for the next delta request  are displayed on the detail screen. in the detail screen of transaction rsa7  a  possibly existing customer exit is not taken into account.
,,? case in which fcfs is the best algo
,,12. many problems like a needs 5 resources and b needs 6 resources of same type  then minimum resources needed so that deadlock will not occur?
,,>do you think java is secure and why?
,,****n.b*** never try to attempt the sec-3 first(the staff present there wud persuade u to do it first in order to secure gud marks)  try the other two sections first then return bck to sec-3 if time permits.
,,32) in scheduling algorithms which are logically executed but suspended
,,"users normally use the ""connect"" statement to connect from one database user to another. however  dbas can switch from one user to another without a password. of course it is not advisable to bridge oracle's security  but look at this example: sql> select password from dba_users where username='scott';"
,,5. what are the different cpu scheduling algorithms in os ?
,,how does the scheduler know the time how it should be scheduled.
,,maintaining genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival of any crop. when a crop variety somewhere becomes vulnerable either due to the onslaught of a disease or the soil becoming waterlogged or alkaline  scientists need to breed another variety of the crop for that region. they do this by searching for suitable genes in related varieties and the natural gene pool of rice and introduce harmful features like gene-silencing or change the normal functions of other genes  it would have terrible implications for food security of the rice-eating regions of the world.
,,23. hit ratio of cache  some data was given  don't remember but
,,the output cache also supports variations of cached get or post name/value pairs.
database management system,dml,
,,f) embedded sql :: incorporate ddl dml and t.c.s in programming language.e.g:: using the sql statements in languages such as 'c'  open fetch  execute and close

,,an abstract class is a partial implementation of a class. in other words  at least some of the operations or methods are implemented  but the full implementation is left up to an inherited class.
,,1. how do you find the size of a java object (not the primitive type) ?
,,3. mention four object oriented programming languages?>
,,2. why we cant create object for abstract class?
,,how to crack part a: this is perhaps the most easiest part of the test. an automated sound will instruct us to read a particular number  the key is we should immediately respond and should speak loudly and clearly. but don't read fast. by doing this we can bag max marks.
database management system,joints,
,,self join-its a join foreign key of a table references the same table. outer join--its a join condition used where one can query all the rows of one of the tables in the join condition even though they don't satisfy the join condition.
,,33. two more questions  one each from riveted joints and cotterjoint
,,when i went in the p.i room i found 5 interviewer in front of me. first conversation was the general talks just like tell me about yourself  what you want to do in life  why you want to joint the l&t. etc. general conversation.
,,in the first round they have asked from c  java  c++  data structure and dbms. the questions are conceptual and if you have the concept clear then it will be easy for you. the questions are like representation of tree or linked list using c  sql query like joining  complexity analysis of a c program  any c++ program  method overloading from java  use of super keyword in java  why we use b-tree  string length calculation using pointer  etc.
,,the interview was quite easy. most of the questions were from academic project  3 questions were from oops. he also asked me sql concepts like joins  normalization  triggering  indexing. as he is oracle team lead most of the questions he asked me from oracle that i was unable to answer and i just said that i don't have much knowledge in this. he also asked me to write a program to merge two strings. at the end he asked me to rate myself in java as well as oracle. after that he told many things about wipro when i asked him. my technical interview continued for about 35 minutes after an hour results were declared and i cleared my technical round. after that we were asked to leave for home.
,,if you have good domain knowledge and concepts like java oops  dbms and sql queries  data structures  you can easily crack this interview. never forget to prepare your final year project. prepare dbms specially(join  normalization  transaction  acid properties).
,,basic sql queries. for union  joins  difference between truncate and delete.

,,this round was bit tuff  what ever you fill in form as skills & certification you mention definitely you have questions on it  i mentioned asp.net as certification  hr asked to tell me the life cycle of asp.net  i replied i don't know theoretical concepts i know practical knowledge  then hr asked tell me what you know in asp.net i told creating web page design it running it use off button  image  file uploading & connecting it to data base  immediately hr asked tell me about joints i told i don't know database i know only to use it for project create  update  delete the table  he asked me you would be studied in your collage since i am an it department student he asked me i replied don't know  then he asked me abt bubble sort i told the answer  then asked abt stack i told the answer waited for result with fear but luckily i got selected & gone to hr round. (be bold to say no if you don't know the answer hr will not take it seriously then confusing by telling irrelevant answers)
,,sql queries were from join subqueries clusters etc this portion was tough for me
,,5)in a left outer joint operation what will be returned
,,8). joins topic in sql like which is the better join command to club all the rows and columns?
,,other groups had normal gd  some topics were joint family vs nuclear family  role of govt. in it sector  arrange marriage vs love marriage etc.
,,in technical round they asked me about unix  in sql join  alter  tables.
,,3.nuclear family or joint family........
,,i attended virtusa written test in hyderabad. written test consists of two sections. first section they asked on sql  java  uml  software engineering. sql questions based on joins. try to understand question much quicker.
,,in dbms  difference between dbms and rdbms  joins  keys  normalization and on some important topics.
operating system,buffering,
,,let us think you have marked the answer for a question while the timer is at 00:10 seconds(10 seconds remaining) then please don't get panicked/tensed. once you marked the answer before 2.15 minutes the answer will be automatically saved. if you click on next option on the screen before 2.15 minutes then it will display you the next question and if you don't wish to do so then you have a buffer time of 30 seconds after which the next question will be displayed so you can feel relaxed for a moment(do not follow this for every question).  this helped me personally.
,,consider the following areas for tuning. the order in which steps are listed needs to be maintained to prevent tuning side effects. for example  it is no good increasing the buffer cache if you can reduce i/o by rewriting a sql statement. database design (if it's not too late):
,,7. two buffer ckt were given what is the difference b/w them?
,,the on-line redo log is a set of tow or more on-line redo files that record all committed changes made to the database. whenever a transaction is committed  the corresponding redo entries temporarily stores in redo log buffers of the sga are written to an on-line redo log file by the background process lgwr. the on-line redo log files are used in cyclical fashion.
,,x$kcbcbh     cache buffer current buffer header fixed table. it can predict the potential loss of decreasing the number of database buffers. the db_block_lru_statistics parameter has to be set to true to gather information in this table.
,,f) system global area(sga) :: the sga is a shared memory region allocated by the oracle that contains data and control information for one oracle instance.it consists of database buffer cache and redo log buffer.
,,use the buffer cache advisory over a given workload and then query the v$db_cache_advice table. if a change was necessary then i would use the alter system set db_cache_size command.
,,6.transfering of pages from memory to peripheral devices through buffer is ( spooling)
,,8. cmos inverter main yadi pmos and nmos ko interchange ker de to bo buffer bun jata hai.
,,a) data base writer(dbwr) :: data base writer writes modified blocks from database buffer cache to data files.this is required since the data is not written whenever a transaction is commited.
,,b)logwriter(lgwr) :: logwriter writes the redo log entries to disk. redo log data is generated in redo log buffer of sga. as transaction commits and log buffer fills  lgwr writes log entries into a online redo log file.
,,23. which layer in the osi model is concerned with printer buffering  etc: network/session/transport/..
object_oriented_programing,applet,
,,27-java applet of a moving /waving file is running on one machine then         it means
,,how many users can be added to an application role in sql server 2005?
,,in unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor. the disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. this means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. as this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments. this process is known as the lowest common denominator approach. this leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor  cache  etc). because the clr supplies one or more just in time compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of msil can be jit-compiled and run on any supported architecture.
,,93 if a derived class object is explicitly destroyed by applying the delete operator to a base-class pointer to the object  the _____ function is automatically called on the object
,,3.when an java applet get's downloaded what happens
,,the open hub service enables us to distribute data from an sap bw system  into external data marts  analytical applications  and other applications. we  can ensure controlled distribution using several systems. the central object for  exporting data is the infospoke. we can define the source and the target object  for the data. bw becomes a hub of an enterprise
,,then he asked me to tell oops concepts  inheritance program and application  jdbc connection steps and if possible program too. but i said i don't know.
,,object linking & embedding provides you with the capability to integrate objects from many ms-windows applications into a single compound document creating integrated applications enables you to use the features form .
,,now lady hr started and scanned each application and resume which we had submitted already. she started with one of guy from 5 members. guys they were observing how you behave for situation. they asked questions like difference between c and c++ and java etc. be perfect with your resume. don't include topics which you don't no. they will trap you easily. they asked some sql concepts. mainly they concentrated on projects we have done during engineering  be perfect with it. be confident and present properly. if you guys get nervous don't show it. big mnc golden opportunity don't do mistake guys.
,,imagine this scenario: i/o completion ports are communictaions ports which take handles to files  sockets  or any other i/o. when a read or write is submitted to them  they cache the data (if necessary)  and attempt to take the request to completion. upon error or completion  they call a user-supplied function to let the users application know that that particular request has completed. they work asynchronously  and can process an unlimited number of simultaneous requests. design the implementation and thread models for i/o completion ports. remember to take into account multi-processor machines.
,,key mode : specifies how oracle forms uniquely identifies rows in the database.this is property includes for application that will run against non-oracle datasources .
,,recovery is the process of applying redo logs to the database to roll it forward. one can roll-forward until a specific point-in-time (before the disaster occurred)  or roll-forward until the last transaction recorded in the log files. sql> connect sys as sysdba
,,a flexfield is an oracle applications field made up of segments. each segment has an assigned name and a set of valid values. oracle applications uses flexfields to capture information about your organization. there are two types of flexfields: key flexfields and descriptive flexfields.
,,visual attributes are the font  color  and pattern properties that you set for form and menu objects that appear in your application's interface.
,,22. what happens when an application is opened as like an ms word and u       press tab key then the response seen is the cursor moving a bit on the       word document.so what r the processes (no jargon give the proper technical       terms) behind this whole thing happening?
,,me : swings  applets sir. i am also interested in working with jdbc and explained about my project that i have done with swings and jdbc.

,,the key used in the gears for   transmitting power(flat/saddle/spline/square)
,,can one use dynamic sql within pl/sql? or can you use a ddl in a procedure ? how ?
,,ddl triggers cannot be signed  but all the other objects can.
,,around 47 students cleared this round. if you clear online test than 70% of your work is done but don't relax. for technical interview  be prepared with one of your core subjects. if you are from ece be prepared with digital electronics/microprocessors and basic programs. also you may be asked to write program in c/c++/java language(the one language you have chosen during online test). learn few basic sql queries related to groupby while etc.
,,this section is also moderate and some questions are high level. there is 10 questions from unix  10 questions from sql  last 10 questions from c  java  c++ based on your selection when you're starting exam. better to choose c. unix and sql is mandatory.
,,type export should be performed complete cumulative incremental. list the sequence of events when a large transaction that exceeds beyond its optimal value when an entry wraps and causes the rollback segment to expand into anotion completes. e. will be written.

,,the most restrictive permission set should always be used for .net assemblies in keeping with a secure sql server environment. only the external_access and unsafe permission sets will allow registry access and unsafe permissions are not required.
,,1 - how do you provide security to your project.
,,"users normally use the ""connect"" statement to connect from one database user to another. however  dbas can switch from one user to another without a password. of course it is not advisable to bridge oracle's security  but look at this example: sql> select password from dba_users where username='scott';"
,,? see the figure numbers correctly they ask question by just giving the figure no. and also the calculations may also be asked. the results were declared and i cleared the round technical interview the techinal interviewer asked me to write few programs on c and he almost asked all the topics like operation systems information security- authentication authourisation dbms data structures java prepare well for all the topics hr its very simple.
,,"i've said as follows in deloitte interview - ""when i was in 12th standard  my father again joined our family and did all those things in order to distract me from getting high score in 12th and he has openly said about that too. inspite of that  i was able to secure 1171 out of 1200 and emerged out as school topper"""

,,we had to go to polaris company for interview which is located in gachibowli  firstly i was shocked to see the campus because its my first mnc which i've entered into. even security guards room was equipped with ac  that amazes me very much. after some time we've entered into the office  they served us with snacks. the interview in polaris is quite different from others  they will ask you different situations and asks what will you do in that situation and how will you react it  all of them says real life problems  it lasts for 25-30 mins. i was lucky the interviewer is very much friendly to me. he asked many questions  i remember only some of them.
,,there was upper limit for cut off. students who secured between given limits were selected for technical and hr interview. expected cut off was 15-20 for technical written.
,,****n.b*** never try to attempt the sec-3 first(the staff present there wud persuade u to do it first in order to secure gud marks)  try the other two sections first then return bck to sec-3 if time permits.

,,how secure are encrypted stored procedures  triggers and views?
,,maintaining genetic diversity is crucial for the long-term survival of any crop. when a crop variety somewhere becomes vulnerable either due to the onslaught of a disease or the soil becoming waterlogged or alkaline  scientists need to breed another variety of the crop for that region. they do this by searching for suitable genes in related varieties and the natural gene pool of rice and introduce harmful features like gene-silencing or change the normal functions of other genes  it would have terrible implications for food security of the rice-eating regions of the world.
,,the root cause of class conflict its possessiveness or the acquisitive instinct. so long as the ideal that is to be achieved is one of securing the maximum material satisfaction  possessiveness is neither suppressed nor eliminated but grows on what it feeds. nor does it cease to be such - it is possessiveness  still  whether it is confined to only a few or is shared by many.
,,you are developing security policy for your sql servers and have all of the data entry clerks needing access to a series of tables. you create a data entry role and assign the proper permissions as well as add the users.
,,favourite subjects (i said dsa  c and dbms. i didn't say os because for os they were asking w.r.t. linux. in cn they may also ask general about network security  firewall  encryption etc. ca include digital  microprocessor etc)
,,8. a candidate appearing for an examinatio  n has to secure 40% marks to pass paper i. but he secured only 40 marks and failed by 20 marks. what is the maximum mark for paper i?
,,to effectively handle security  you want to minimize the administrative burden. bob is a member of the data entry role  and because of cross training  you do not want to remove him from this role  but you do need to deny permission to the vacation table. the best way to do this is with another role specifically to deny this permission.

,,i explained polymorphism  inheritance.
,,15. what is accessibility of a protected member of a base class which is inherited privately?
,,7) how can you implement inheritance in c++?
,,7.what is the essential feature of inheritance
,,a. private: b'coz the private inheritance makes everything from the base class private in the derived class (ans)
,,constructors-destructors; dynamic binding; polymorphism; inheritance          virtual functionsetc.
,,some background on this: c++ supports multiple inheritance  but c# does not. multiple inheritance in c++ has always be controversial  because the resolution of multiple inherited implementations of the same method from different base classes is hard to control and anticipate. c# decided to avoid this problem by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces  which do not contain method implementations  but restricting a class to have at most a single parent class. although this can result in redundant implementations of the same method when different classes implement the same interface  it is still an excellent compromise.
,,referencing allows you to create objects that inherit their functionality and appearance from other objects. referencing an object is similar to copying an object  except that the resulting reference object maintains a link to its source object. a reference object automatically inherits any changes that have been made to the source object when you open or regenerate the module that contains the reference object. any string expression up to 32k:
,,multiple inheritance (2 questions)
,,1. java basics what is object  class  abstraction  polymorphism  inheritance?
,,an interface is not a class. it is an entity that is defined by the word interface. an interface has no implementation; it only has the signature or in other words  just the definition of the methods without the body. as one of the similarities to abstract class  it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclasses or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments. the main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. since c# doesn?t support multiple inheritance  interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.what is serialization  how it works in .net?
,,abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. they are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. one key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. a class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed. they also version well  because if additional functionality is needed in derived classes  it can be added to the base class without breaking code.
,,he asked about what is polymorphism  inheritence etc.
,,yes   partially. 1) property class - inheritance property 2) overloading : procedures and functions.
,,he asked to draw the architecture of 8085  in c++ to define inheritance  oop and polymorphism etc.
,,the questions were very simple like about the company  net revenue  location of headquarters  ceo  our mini project  any key role played in mini project  any innovative ideas you came up with  basic questions on c and java like what are the three oop principles  what is encapsulation  what is inheritance. etc.
,,then he asked me to tell oops concepts  inheritance program and application  jdbc connection steps and if possible program too. but i said i don't know.
,,one additional key difference between interfaces and abstract classes (possibly the most important one) is that multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class  but only one abstract class can be inherited by any single class.
,,7. he asked about inheritance  polymorphism  abstraction  encapsulation  etc
,,tech rnd2: threads  again they told to write programs in encapsulation  inheritance  abstraction  about project.
,,- how can we achieve multiple inheritance in java?
,,you can change the appearance of objects at runtime by changing the named visual attribute programmatically; property class assignment cannot be changed programmatically. when an object is inheriting from both a property class and a named visual attribute  the named visual attribute settings take precedence  and any visual attribute properties in the class are ignored.
,,5) complete oops concept. please be completely prepared with realtime example and use of oops concept in program and program to illustrate inheritance (overloading and overriding).
,,he: can you explain how would you use java oops properties with help of program (he wants me to write a program in which i have to use all the basic oops properties like abstraction  inheritance  polymorphism etc).
,,7. he asked about inheritance  polymorphism  abstration encapsulation  etc...
,,2) compile time error indicating that you cannot inherit from a class with final methods
,,an abstract class is a partial implementation of a class. in other words  at least some of the operations or methods are implemented  but the full implementation is left up to an inherited class.
,,- c++ questions like polymorphism  runtime polymorphism  inheritance etc.
,,c++ (oops inheritance polymorphism etc) just be clear with basics.
,,a property clause is a named object that contains a list of properties and their settings. once you create a property clause you can base other object on it. an object based on a property can inherit the setting of any property in the clause that makes sense for that object.

database management system,transaction,
,,partly available - contains data from an unresolved transaction involving a distributed database.
,,the on-line redo log is a set of tow or more on-line redo files that record all committed changes made to the database. whenever a transaction is committed  the corresponding redo entries temporarily stores in redo log buffers of the sga are written to an on-line redo log file by the background process lgwr. the on-line redo log files are used in cyclical fashion.

,,4. the effect of the rollback command in a transaction is the following
,,b)logwriter(lgwr) :: logwriter writes the redo log entries to disk. redo log data is generated in redo log buffer of sga. as transaction commits and log buffer fills  lgwr writes log entries into a online redo log file.
,,for long transactions that contain many sql statements  intermediate markers or savepoints can be declared which can be used to divide a transaction into smaller parts. this allows the option of later rolling back all work performed from the current point in the transaction to a declared savepoint within the transaction.
,,type export should be performed complete cumulative incremental. list the sequence of events when a large transaction that exceeds beyond its optimal value when an entry wraps and causes the rollback segment to expand into anotion completes. e. will be written.
,,if you have good domain knowledge and concepts like java oops  dbms and sql queries  data structures  you can easily crack this interview. never forget to prepare your final year project. prepare dbms specially(join  normalization  transaction  acid properties).
,,a) the number on the overview screen corresponds to the total of luws (see  also first question) that were written to the qrfc queue and that have not yet  been confirmed. the detail screen displays the records contained in the luws.  both  the records belonging to the previous delta request and the records that  do not meet the selection conditions of the preceding delta init requests are  filtered out. thus  only the records that are ready for the next delta request  are displayed on the detail screen. in the detail screen of transaction rsa7  a  possibly existing customer exit is not taken into account.
,,this level of error severity indicates a transaction deadlock error.
,,recovery is the process of applying redo logs to the database to roll it forward. one can roll-forward until a specific point-in-time (before the disaster occurred)  or roll-forward until the last transaction recorded in the log files. sql> connect sys as sysdba
,,c) transaction control statements :: manage change by dml
,,rollback retracts any of the changes resulting from the sql statements in the transaction.
,,q) i would like to display the date the data was uploaded  on the report. usually  we load the transactional data nightly. is there any  easy way to include this information on the report for users? so that they know  the validity of the report.
,,1. in what way are data warehouses different from databases? (this has  taken most of my time  since we got into a discussion of each and  every aspect. some important aspects touched upon are: oltp  transactions and olap transactions  querying  response-time of a  database  load on the database  query processing etc.).
,,commit makes permanent the changes resulting from all sql statements in the transaction. the changes made by the sql statements of a transaction become visible to other user sessions transactions that start only after transaction is committed.
,,you can use tracer tokens in sql server 2005 replication to measure latencies. these are small amounts of data written into your transaction logs.
,,b. read is done when the transaction is not yet committed
,,b) transactional load partitioning improvement:
,,the answer is an acronym that describes concurrency support in a database. acid is an acronym for the following four terms: * atomicity - every operation within a transaction is treated as a singular operation; either all of its data modifications are performed  or none of them is performed.
,,a) data base writer(dbwr) :: data base writer writes modified blocks from database buffer cache to data files.this is required since the data is not written whenever a transaction is commited.
,,multiple database support : oracle has a superior ability to manage multiple databases within the same transaction using a two-phase commit protocol.

,,a certificate is like an asymmetric key and can validate the identity of the issuer.
,,abstract classes are closely related to interfaces. they are classes that cannot be instantiated  and are frequently either partially implemented  or not at all implemented. one key difference between abstract classes and interfaces is that a class may implement an unlimited number of interfaces  but may inherit from only one abstract (or any other kind of) class. a class that is derived from an abstract class may still implement interfaces. abstract classes are useful when creating components because they allow you specify an invariant level of functionality in some methods  but leave the implementation of other methods until a specific implementation of that class is needed. they also version well  because if additional functionality is needed in derived classes  it can be added to the base class without breaking code.
,,next they asked about sql and unix. in sql how to delete duplicates in a table like:

,,"generally for any interviews we might have heard of having group discussions on general topics but for lg soft it is completely different. they will give you a technical topic and would divide the crowd into 2 groups. they will give 10 minutes for one group to support their concept and in the same way other group too! what i felt was that it was more like a debate than a discussion. in this round they will not assess our communication skills or management skills rather they would specifically analyze our technical knowledge. for us the topic was ""procedural oriented vs object oriented"". i initially  thought that it was an easy topic to discuss but as it is a competition we will not easily get chance to express and support our words. somehow i tried to convey the things that i know and actively participated in the discussion. after 10 minutes they will change the positions of the 2 groups and would ask you to speak. now  we should be very careful. we should not repeat the points that were already mentioned by some other people. i confidently discussed with my competitors and somehow qualified in the second round."

,,hr-tell me about foreign key and primary key?
,,one additional key difference between interfaces and abstract classes (possibly the most important one) is that multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class  but only one abstract class can be inherited by any single class.
,,function key triggers are associated with individual sql*forms function keys you can attach key function triggers to 10 keys or key sequences that normally do not perform any sql * forms operations. these keys referred as key f0 through key f9.
,,7. he asked about inheritance  polymorphism  abstraction  encapsulation  etc
,,how to crack part c: this is another tricky area of the test. listening skills are going to be the key for part b and c. automated voice asks questions we have to answer them in two or three words max (two is suggestible). sometimes answer will be in the question it self or it will be a direct question.

,,a record group is an internal oracle forms data structure that has a column/row framework similar to a database table. however  unlike database tables  record groups are separate objects that belong to the form module in which they are defined. a record group can have an unlimited number of columns of type char  long  number  or date provided that the total number of columns does not exceed 64k. record group column names cannot exceed 30 characters.

,,me:: (i said a small ex  like this... i showed the door beside me and said like this..) theif will unlock the door without exact key. and if that thief is given a chance to prepare the lock and key  he will do it perfectly in such a way that  no other theif can unlock it. just like that if a tester comes to development and writes a code  the code will be in such a way that no other tester can find any bugs in it. so that way i can be a good developer  even though i ma with 1.5 yrs expereienced in testing and away from development.
,,also had technical questions. questions based on algorithms. so be prepared with commonly asked n used sorting and searching algorithms. then questions to write output of code snippet given. all are objective questions.
,,self join-its a join foreign key of a table references the same table. outer join--its a join condition used where one can query all the rows of one of the tables in the join condition even though they don't satisfy the join condition.
,,in unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor. the disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. this means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. as this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments. this process is known as the lowest common denominator approach. this leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor  cache  etc). because the clr supplies one or more just in time compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of msil can be jit-compiled and run on any supported architecture.
,,14.difference between dbms n rdbms (told abt e.m.codd's 12 rules n key concept)
,,the interview was quite easy. most of the questions were from academic project  3 questions were from oops. he also asked me sql concepts like joins  normalization  triggering  indexing. as he is oracle team lead most of the questions he asked me from oracle that i was unable to answer and i just said that i don't have much knowledge in this. he also asked me to write a program to merge two strings. at the end he asked me to rate myself in java as well as oracle. after that he told many things about wipro when i asked him. my technical interview continued for about 35 minutes after an hour results were declared and i cleared my technical round. after that we were asked to leave for home.
,,72. in gear boxes which type of key is used
,,around 47 students cleared this round. if you clear online test than 70% of your work is done but don't relax. for technical interview  be prepared with one of your core subjects. if you are from ece be prepared with digital electronics/microprocessors and basic programs. also you may be asked to write program in c/c++/java language(the one language you have chosen during online test). learn few basic sql queries related to groupby while etc.
