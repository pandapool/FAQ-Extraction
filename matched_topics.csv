145,145,When estimating smooth limits  both the number of LUWs is important and the average data volume per LUW As a rule  we recommend to bundle data usually documents already when writing to the DeltaQueue to keep number of LUWs small partly this can be set in the applications  eg in the Logistics Cockpit The data volume of a single LUW should not be considerably larger than 10 of the memory available to the work process for data extraction in a 32bit architecture with a memory volume of about 1GByte per work process  100 Mbytes per LUW should not be exceeded That limit is of rather small practical importance as well since a comparable limit already applies when writing to the DeltaQueue If the limit is observed  correct reading is guaranteed in most cases,Number representations and computer  arithmetic

243,243,In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to recompile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure processor  cache  etc Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JITcompiled and run on any supported architecture,Number representations and computer  arithmetic

763,763, Learning Curve  despite the misleading name  ADONET is not simply a new version of ADO  nor should it even be considered a direct successor ADONET should be thought of more as the data access class library for use with the NET framework The difficulty in learning to use ADONET to its fullest is that a lot of it does seem familiar It is this that causes some common pitfalls Programmers need to learn that even though some syntax may appear the same  there is actually a considerable amount of difference in the internal workings of many classes For example this will be discussed in far more detail later  an ADONET DataSet is nothing at all like a disconnected ADO RecordSet Some may consider a learning curve a drawback  but I consider learning curves more like scheduling issues Theres a learning curve in learning anything new its just up to you to schedule that curve into your time so that you can learn the new technology at a pace that fits your schedule,Asymptotic  worst  case  time  and  space  complexity
764,764,When compiling to managed code  the compiler translates your source code into Microsoft intermediate language MSIL  which is a CPUindependent set of instructions that can be efficiently converted to native code Intermediate Language is a binary assembly language that is compiled at runtime down to whatever machine language is appropriate for the host CPU This runtime compilation is called JustInTime Compiling or JITcompiling,Instruction pipelining
765,765,In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to recompile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure processor  cache  etc Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JITcompiled and run on any supported architecture,Number representations and computer  arithmetic

1222,1222,In theMicrosoft NET framework an assembly is a partially compiled code library for use in deployment  versioning and security In the Microsoft Windows implementation of NET  an assembly is a PE portable executable file There are two types  process assemblies EXE and library assemblies DLL A process assembly represents a process which will use classes defined in library assemblies In version 11 of the CLR classes can only be exported from library assemblies in version 20 this restriction is relaxed The compiler will have a switch to determine if the assembly is a process or library and will set a flag in the PE file NET does not use the extension to determine if the file is a process or library This means that a library may have either dll or exe as its extension,Intermediate code generation
1223,1223, ManagedOnly Access  for a few obvious reasons  and some far more technical  you cannot utilize the ADONET architecture from anything but managed code This means that there is no COM interoperability allowed for ADONET Therefore  in order to take advantage of the advanced SQL Server Data Provider and any other feature like DataSets  XML internal data storage  etc  your code must be running under the CLR,main  memory  and  secondary  storage
1224,1224,When compiling to managed code  the compiler translates your source code into Microsoft intermediate language MSIL  which is a CPUindependent set of instructions that can be efficiently converted to native code Intermediate Language is a binary assembly language that is compiled at runtime down to whatever machine language is appropriate for the host CPU This runtime compilation is called JustInTime Compiling or JITcompiling,Instruction pipelining
1225,1225,In unmanaged environments the compiler and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that are targeted at a specific processor The disadvantage of this process is that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you will have to recompile the code using a compiler and linker that will compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware This means that each time you want your application to run on a different platform  you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again As this leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same application  the companies try to create a more generalized compiled version in order to target most of the environments This process is known as the Lowest Common Denominator approach This leads to a more generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure processor  cache  etc Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each computer architecture it supports  the same set of MSIL can be JITcompiled and run on any supported architecture,Number representations and computer  arithmetic

2202,2202,When estimating smooth limits  both the number of LUWs is important and the average data volume per LUW As a rule  we recommend to bundle data usually documents already when writing to the DeltaQueue to keep number of LUWs small partly this can be set in the applications  eg in the Logistics Cockpit The data volume of a single LUW should not be considerably larger than 10 of the memory available to the work process for data extraction in a 32bit architecture with a memory volume of about 1GByte per work process  100 Mbytes per LUW should not be exceeded That limit is of rather small practical importance as well since a comparable limit already applies when writing to the DeltaQueue If the limit is observed  correct reading is guaranteed in most cases,Number representations and computer  arithmetic
2203,2203,If the number of LUWs cannot be reduced by bundling application transactions  you should at least make sure that the data are fetched from all connected BWs as quickly as possible But for other  BWspecific  reasons  the frequency should not be higher than one DeltaRequest per hour,Number representations and computer  arithmetic

2406,2406,If your basics in technical is clear u will definetly crack hexaware,Basics  of  Wi-Fi
2407,2407,In the interview process he may give the ques to write a progam for desired one  or he can give a set of ques on ur BTech basics ie micro processors  control systems  network theory etc Out of 26 members  I was around 14th member called,data?path and control unit
2408,2408,In the interview process he may give the ques to write a progam for desired one or he can give a set if ques on ur BTech basics,Basics  of  Wi-Fi
2409,2409,What is the basic requirement of a realtime network ,Asymptotic  worst  case  time  and  space  complexity
2410,2410,In technical interview they asked only the basics  and about the project and what I have mentioned in the resume and about the embedded protocols,Basics  of  Wi-Fi
2411,2411,In written exam  totally 50 questions In that 10 questions from aptitude quants profit and loss percentages and number system  reasoning data arrangement  data interpretation and 40 questions from technical networking  computer basics  OS  MS Office shortcuts  MS outlook,Number representations and computer  arithmetic
2412,2412,In technical interview  they asked about computer networks  project and internship  workshops if any We have to brush up with some basics in core subjects,Number representations and computer  arithmetic
2413,2413,If you are from CSE discipline  you are through this OS consisted of problems with average turn around time  NTFS FAT32 file systems  and very basic OS concepts Two Unix commands were concatenated using pipe and the output was asked And one pattern searching problem also appeared under Unix,binary  search trees
2414,2414,In this round basic Aptitude question were asked similar to other companies aptitude paper and was slightly challenging paper as question was easy but required time management as few question required more calculation We can see all the question at once so we were able to select question I am not exactly sure with no of question and time but it was 40 question in 40 minute Time management will be the key to qualify this round In my college more than 50 student cleared the round,Asymptotic  worst  case  time  and  space  complexity
